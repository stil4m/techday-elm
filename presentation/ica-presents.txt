- Why we do JS
  - setup
    - JS -> Simple
    - Java -> Hard
  - tooling
    - Java -> Maven, Ant, Gradle
	- JS -> npm
  - Learning curve
    - JS -> short function
	- Java -> All those types
  
- Not only merits
  - The community lacks quality. Too easy to publish. Semver. Testing.
  - What is 'this'?
  - Inconsistent (stringEquals, 0.0 == "0")

- JavaScript is a great platform. Not a great language.

- Maintainability
  - Things break for no *good* reason.
  - What the hell is 'opts' in function (opts)
  - or what the hell is true in 'doSomething("hello", true)', 'doSomething("world")'
  - the main problem is the language lets you do it.
